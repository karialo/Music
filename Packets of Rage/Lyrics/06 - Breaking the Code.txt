I don’t know what’s worth fixing anymore,
Every loop returns me to the floor.
Lines of logic wrap around my brain,
Tried to patch the leak but fed the pain.

I debug in circles, can’t break free,
The same mistake keeps haunting me.

Breaking the code — I’m stuck inside,
Trying to rewrite the part that died.
Breaking the code — I lose my head,
Fix one bug and another spreads.

Error logs like ghosts, they scream and shout,
Stack traces pull the system down.
I break it down to start again,
But every fix just fuels the sin.

I debug in circles, can’t break free,
The same mistake keeps haunting me.

Breaking the code — I’m stuck inside,
Trying to rewrite the part that died.
Breaking the code — I lose my head,
Fix one bug and another spreads.

I lash the lines, I cut the thread,
But the pattern’s carved inside my head.
Repeating loops, can’t stop the flow,
Breaking the code that won’t let go.

Breaking the code — I’m stuck inside,
Trying to rewrite the part that died.
Breaking the code — I lose my head,
Fix one bug and another spreads.
