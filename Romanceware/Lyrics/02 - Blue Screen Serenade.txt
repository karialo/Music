Your shadow lingers on my screen,
lines of code I can’t redeem,
heartbeat frozen, time decayed,
I lost myself the night you strayed.

And every crash is just a song,
singing what I did so wrong,
pixels blur where tears cascade,
this is my blue screen serenade.

Blue screen serenade,
sing to me in static waves,
echoes in electric rain,
I’ll reboot but not the same.

Blue screen serenade,
drowning in your binary grave,
hold me in this frozen state,
love erased, too late.

Memory leaks into the dark,
ghostly echoes where you are,
booting love was just pretend,
no command can bring back friends.

Ctrl my hope, Alt for escape,
Delete the ache I can’t replace,
frozen frame, I watch it fade,
still I sing this serenade.

Blue screen serenade,
sing to me in static waves,
echoes in electric rain,
I’ll reboot but not the same.

Blue screen serenade,
if only you could override,
write me once and stay this time,
love.exe denied.
