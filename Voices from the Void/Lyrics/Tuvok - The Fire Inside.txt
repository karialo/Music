I feel the burn behind the veil—
A furnace wrapped in Vulcan scale.
Trained to breathe in silence deep,
Where thoughts ignite but never leap.

Born of logic, forged by flame,
I hold the heat, deny the name.
Anger, fear… emotions crawl,
But I command. I do not fall.

The fire inside… is mine to hold,
It does not wither. It does not scold.
It speaks in heat, but I reply—
With stillness steeped in reasoned sky.
The fire inside… burns slow, burns wise,
Not seen in hands, but in the eyes.

The duty binds, the chaos flows,
Security in silence grows.
But make no error, make no slip—
My patience holds a lightning grip.
Tactical. Loyal. Unafraid.
Each motion calm, each move well-played.
Yet even now, I count the cost—
For logic gained is something lost.

I have danced with doubt in a dreaming plain,
Felt madness kiss my neural chain.
But I endured.
As Vulcans… do.

The fire inside is not my foe,
It lights the path I choose to know.
Through time, through space, through inner tide—
I remain.
I do not hide.

“Emotion is the shadow.
Discipline… is the light.”
