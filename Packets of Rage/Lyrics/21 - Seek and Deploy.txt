SEEK! — DEPLOY! — SEEK! — DEPLOY!

Scanner eyes across the night,
Ports unlocked under neon light.
Probe the open, find the seam,
Ripping holes into the stream.

Headers, flags, they scream and cry,
Targets blinking in my eye.

Seek and deploy!
Find the hole and bring the joy!
Seek and deploy!
Spread the code and watch it toy!

Silent hosts, a secret door,
Push the payload to the core.
Patch the hole? — they’re far too late,
We’ve crawled inside, we own the gate.

Fire the packets, flood the lane,
Watch their systems choke in pain.

Seek and deploy!
Find the hole and bring the joy!
Seek and deploy!
Spread the code and watch it toy!

Scan, scan, scan — the night obeys,
Crack the frame and light the blaze.
Exploit, inject, we’re dancing now,
Watch the banners fold and bow.

Seek and deploy!
Find the hole and bring the joy!
Seek and deploy!
Spread the code and watch it toy!

Deploy!
