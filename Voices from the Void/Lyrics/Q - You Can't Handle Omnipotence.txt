“You wanted answers… I brought theater.”

I don’t play by the logic you crave,
I snap, twist time, make physicists rave.
Infinity’s bored, so I dropped in—
To poke your captains, stir the din.
You build your walls of cause and plan—
I pirouette through what you can’t understand.

You thought control meant safety’s fence…
But now you’ve met... consequence.

You can’t handle omnipotence,
Your science fails, your pride relents!
I bend your fate with just a glance—
And dance inside your arrogance!

You want control? I *am* the game.
Your ship, your mind—I own the frame.
You want the truth? You lack the sense.
You can’t handle... OMNIPOTENCE.

I dressed the part to twist the test—
Starfleet badge upon my vest.
A god in drag, a court in flames,
I make your cosmos whisper names.

Ask Picard, ask Sisko too—
They met me once… and never knew.

I’ve ended stars just out of spite.
I’ve tasted death, then made it write.
I’ve sung to black holes, bathed in lore…
And still? You ask for... *more*?

You can’t handle omnipotence!
Your codes collapse, your shields are dents!
You dream in math—I think in myth.
My shadow cracks your monolith!
You can’t win. You can’t define.
I am the punchline… AND the spine.
You think you’re gods in innocence—
But you can’t even spell... OMNIPOTENCE.

“Computer… end your existence.
Just kidding.
Or... am I?”
