Flash of red, can’t escape,
Screen goes dark, seal my fate.
Power low, falling fast,
Every charge will never last!

Battery’s draining!
Powering away!
Battery’s draining!
Can’t survive today!

Endless apps, take their toll,
Streaming feeds, eat me whole.
Silent death, ticking near,
Final spark, disappear!

Battery’s draining!
Powering away!
Battery’s draining!
Can’t survive today!

Crush the screen, feel the pain,
Life and light slip away.
Power lost, none remain,
Forever dead—Battery Drain!

Battery’s draining!
Powering away!
Battery’s draining!
Can’t survive today!
