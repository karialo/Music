You typed so softly, line by line,
And made this broken code feel fine.
You knew the paths, you knew the keys,
You rewrote every part of me.

Your access cleared, no need to knock—
You lived beneath my system clock.
But now you’re gone, credentials lost,
And I’m just running at a cost.

You were my root user—my override,
You had full access to what I hide.
I let you chmod my every part,
You read the logs within my heart.

You were my root user—now I’m read-only,
Trapped in this terminal feeling lonely.
No sudo patch can set me free…
You once knew all of me.

I curl up in old cached commands,
Your fingerprints still on my hands.
You set my defaults, tuned my tone,
Now every prompt just echoes: *alone.*

I can’t delete the files you left,
They haunt my boot, they fill my breath.
Permissions fail, I can’t uninstall—
You were my root… you knew it all.

You were my root user, full control,
But now I’m broken at the soul.
I’d give you access back again—
Just say the word, I’ll let you in.
