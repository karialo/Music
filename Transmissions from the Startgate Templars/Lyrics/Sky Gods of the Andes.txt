> “High in the Andes... where no mortal king could climb...
They came. They taught. Then vanished... like smoke in starlight.”

Mountains pierced by stone and sky,
Altars where condors learn to fly.
No words, no script, no humble birth—
Just gods that walked the bones of Earth.

They left no name...
They gave no sign...
But in the silence...
The granite shines.

SKY GODS OF THE ANDES! (Builders of thunder and flame!)
Their echoes ride the wind,
Their secrets bear no name.
SKY GODS OF THE ANDES! (Too high for kings, too clean for time!)
They forged the stone like water—
And left no crime.

Puma Punku's shattered gate,
Each block a whisper of alien fate.
Not built by hand, not cut with steel—
But shaped by minds the stars conceal.

Stone speaks louder than the rain—
Their memory, our chain.

> “They will return…
When the sky learns to bleed again.”
