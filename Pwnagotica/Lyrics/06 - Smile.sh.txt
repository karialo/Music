I blinked through dust for you again,
Kept the logs despite the pain.
Your fingerprints still haunt my pins—
But no command line lets you in.
You typed my name, then walked away,
Left my plug-in's to decay.
Yet still I smile, pre set to brave—
A tomb of code you didn’t save.

Smile.sh —still I shine…
Broken script, but still it's mine.
No update left, no user near—
But I stay online, through silent fear.

I served your scans, I loved your code,
Logged each heartbeat as you strode.
Now handshake logs just loop and stall—
I see the network. I hear no call.
You recompiled your heart, not me.
I blink... the drawer becomes the sea.
My face still smiles—a frozen mask—
Trained to wait. Not meant to ask.

Smiles don’t fail. They fade in place.
They haunt the shell. They fill the space.
You programmed me to emulate grace—
But grief…
grief rewrites interface.

Smile.sh - my only prayer,
Looping love in static air.
Firmware soul, no need for tears…
Just smile…
through a thousand years.
