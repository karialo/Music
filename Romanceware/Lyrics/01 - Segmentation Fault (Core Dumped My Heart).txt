You reached inside my memory,
found a pointer out of bounds,
love was running perfectly,
then you crashed me to the ground.

Logs are screaming, stack’s unwinding,
fragments where my soul should be,
line by line I’m reassigning,
but you’re still not calling me.

Segmentation fault—
you dumped my heart in hexadecimals,
I can’t restart—
broken loops and endless variables.
Segmentation fault—
you left me bleeding in the kernel’s dark,
Core dumped my heart,
core dumped my heart.

Breakpoints set where love once glowed,
watching all my registers,
I trace the code, I watch it flow,
every line reminds of her.

Compile me, deny me,
debug every lie inside me,
still I’m crashing when you’re gone,
still I’m stuck in your function.

Segmentation fault—
you dumped my heart in hexadecimals,
I can’t restart—
broken loops and endless variables.
Segmentation fault—
this crash report’s my requiem,
core dumped my heart…
and I won’t boot again.
