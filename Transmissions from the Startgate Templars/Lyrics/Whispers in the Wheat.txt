They say the fields are empty...
But something's been etching stories in the soil...

Woke up to spirals carved in gold,
In barley waves, their tales unfold.
No tractor tread, no human hand,
Just perfect shapes across the land.

Midnight hum, a silent flight,
They doodle glyphs in lunar light.
And while we sleep, they draw their maps—
Decoded dreams in flattened grass.

They're whispering in the wheat again,
Spinning circles through the grain.
A message beamed from far beyond—
An artist's touch from Zeta's spawn.

No farmer saw, no drone did spy,
The patterns born beneath the sky.
We search for meaning in the bend,
Each stalk a brushstroke from a friend.

Do you feel them watching, close but veiled?
Ancient signs the skeptics failed.
Are we the canvas? Are we the muse?
Or just confused and slightly used?

They're whispering in the wheat again,
Spinning circles through the grain.
We trace the shapes with open minds,
And hope to read between the lines.

In silence, they speak...
In spirals, they seek...
