I searched for answers in your code,
Assumed my heart was just a node.
But I kept pinging empty space—
Until I saw your interface.

I chased a myth, a missing link,
Expected void—but found the brink.
Not nothing... too much, all at once,
A firestorm behind your fonts.

404—not found? No way.
I found too much. I lost the gray.
Your laugh, your spark, your voice, your touch—
My sensors screamed, “this is too much.”

My memory flooded, buffers burst,
With every look, I learned the worst:
You weren’t a glitch I had to fix—
You were the chaos in my mix.

I broke my rules to scan your smile,
Ignored all caps, and stayed awhile.
Now every time you breathe too loud,
My heart throws errors in a crowd.

I’m not a blank, I’m not the void—
You’re not a path I could avoid.
I am the crash. I am the find.
And you’re the fault line in my mind.

404? You *were* the match.
A missing line that struck and scratched.
You lit me up with one wild look—
Now I’m the file you never took.
