Lay beside me, left alone,
Cold device without a home.
Cables tangled, lights all fade,
Unconfigured, still betrayed.

Once I trusted, once I tried,
Left abandoned, left denied.

So I update you… so I rewire you…
So I configure you… but you’re broken too.
Unconfigured 2.

Power flickers, ghost inside,
Firmware lost, nowhere to hide.
Left to silence, left to dust,
Unconfigured, lost my trust.

Once I hoped and once I dreamed,
Nothing’s ever what it seemed.

So I reset you… so I revive you…
So I configure you… but you’re broken too.
Unconfigured 2.

What I’ve built, I tear apart,
Every key breaks from the start.
Still I try to make you whole,
Unconfigured, no control.

So I restore you… so I redesign you…
So I configure you… but you’re broken too.
Unconfigured 2.

Left alone… left alone…
Unconfigured…
Unconfigured 2.
