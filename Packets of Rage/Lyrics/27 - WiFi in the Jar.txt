As I was goin’ over the far side of the city,
I saw a Wi-Fi signal, strong but lookin’ shitty.
I first produced my laptop, and then produced my phone,
Saying, “Stand and deliver, for you’re open and alone!”

Wi-Fi in the jar-o!
Wi-Fi in the jar-o!

I logged into the hotspot, connection quick and sweet,
But all my data vanished, devoured in defeat.
The router gave a chuckle, the barmaid gave a grin,
I knew this cursed connection had done me in again.

Wi-Fi in the jar-o!
Wi-Fi in the jar-o!

Some take delight in gaming, and some take delight in code,
But I take delight in Wi-Fi, though it steals the motherlode.

Wi-Fi in the jar-o!
Wi-Fi in the jar-o!
