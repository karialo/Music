Heartbeat stalled, screen went black,
I was fine—then came the stack.
One stray line, a silent scream,
Crashing deep inside a dream.

I spiraled hard in nested loops,
Logs unread, no rescue troops.
Frozen frame, a static moan—
I glitched out, and died alone.

Kernel panic in my soul,
No escape, no control.
Every thread just went insane,
Overflowing with your name.

Segfault tears on broken skin,
Lost inside the state I’m in.
Fatal error, no console…
Kernel panic in my soul.

Exception caught, no handler there,
I felt you leave, mid-system prayer.
My moods collapsed in tangled code—
Emotion's stack... about to explode.

The clock ticks on, but I’ve stalled out,
Corrupted thoughts and kernel doubt.
Please don’t touch—don’t try to scroll—
I’m not a file. I’m not whole.

Kernel panic in my soul,
Fragmented bytes I can’t console.
Try to reboot? It’s just a shell—
I’m stuck inside this private hell.

Segfault dreams, no way to cope,
Buffer floods, and loss of hope.
No reboot, no self-control…
Kernel panic in my soul.
