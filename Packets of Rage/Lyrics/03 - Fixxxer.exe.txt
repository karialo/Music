Dolls of code they sew me tight,
Updates whisper through the night.
Broken patches, endless pain,
Every fix just breaks again.

Code in me, pulling strings,
Silent curse, the error sings.

Fixxxer.exe…
It owns me.
Fixxxer.exe…
Consumes me.

Every patch a poisoned seed,
Every line a fatal bleed.
Hands of devs that never sleep,
Pull me down, their curse runs deep.

Code in me, pulling strings,
Silent curse, the error sings.

Fixxxer.exe…
It owns me.
Fixxxer.exe…
Consumes me.

Hexed forever, bound by code,
Carved inside this cursed load.
System bleeds, I can’t be free,
Fixxxer.exe in me.
s
Fixxxer.exe…
It owns me.
Fixxxer.exe…
Consumes me.
Fixxxer.exe…
Forever me.
