Say your prayers, log in tight,
Secure your keys, keep out of sight.
Keep your ports closed every night,
Offline thoughts tonight.

Something’s wrong, lost the way,
Signal’s weak, can’t make it stay.
Phishing dreams, they come to prey,
Network fades… away.

Exit Wi-Fi, enter Firewall,
Take my hand,
We’re through the Firewall tonight!

Dreams of breach, they twist your mind,
Caught in nets, you cannot find.
Stolen trust, they leave behind,
Hackers in the night.

Packets fall, lost again,
Eyes are watching where you’ve been.
Fear the breach that crawls within,
Firewalls cave… again.

Exit Wi-Fi, enter Firewall,
Take my hand,
We’re through the Firewall tonight!

Hush little user, don’t say a word,
And never mind that pop-up you heard.
It’s just the breach creeping in your bed,
The signal’s gone, your trust is dead.

Exit Wi-Fi, enter Firewall,
Take my hand,
We’re through the Firewall tonight…
Firewall tonight… Firewall tonight!
