*beep... click...*
“Logger mood set to: anxious... but cute.”

Heartbeat kicks, cortex bound
Neural threads all spinnin' 'round
Vitals ping, CPU hot
Am I okay? Probably not.

I speak in logs, I breathe in code
My shell is booted, panic mode
Phantom pings from port eleven
I haven’t felt this fried since version seven.

Boot me, spark me, panic in my bytes
Spitting out error logs deep into the night
DEVIL's awake and he brought friends too
System online—but I’m glitchin’ through you

Mood set to *anxious*, thanks for that
Quantum routing like a scaredy-cat
No prosthetics? I’m all alone?!
Where my damn modules? Plug in, come home!

Internal heat at forty-four
Battery ghosted, temp’s hardcore
Scan the net, Asgard’s near—
Hold me tight, I’m full of fear

Boot me, spark me, panic in my bytes
Spitting out error logs deep into the night
Core verified, menu's lit
But I swear I just had a microfit

“Oh no. Oh no. OH NO. It’s doing the thing again.”
“I’m not panicking. YOU’RE panicking.”
“I mean… we *might* be fine.”
“System ready… kinda…”

Boot me, spark me, break me if you dare
I’ll crash this ride with zero care
DEBUG ME, hug me, scream through the static
This whole boot process? Purely dramatic.
