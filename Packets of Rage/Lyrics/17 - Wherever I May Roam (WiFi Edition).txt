And the network becomes my bride,
And the world becomes my side.
And I roam, I roam, I roam,
Through the signals, far from home.

Lost connections on my way,
Hotspot calling, I obey.

Wherever I may roam…
Wi-Fi is my home.
Wherever I may roam…
Wi-Fi is my home.

And the bars that fade to black,
Always leave me crawling back.
Through the streets, through endless night,
Searching for that glowing light.

Lost connections on my way,
Hotspot calling, I obey.

Wherever I may roam…
Wi-Fi is my home.
Wherever I may roam…
Wi-Fi is my home.

Roam… roam…
Signal fades… I’m alone.
Roam… roam…
Wi-Fi calls me home.

Wherever I may roam…
Wi-Fi is my home.
Wherever I may roam…
Wi-Fi is my home.
