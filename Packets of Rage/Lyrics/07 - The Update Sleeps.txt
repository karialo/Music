Where do I take this pain of mine?
I wait, but updates waste my time.
Where do I search to find release?
The cycle spins, it never cease.

So patch me over, system still remains,
So patch me over, and it fails again.

The update sleeps… it waits inside,
The update sleeps… my time denied.
The update sleeps… the screen turns black,
The update sleeps… it won’t come back.

Where do I go to end the load?
A frozen bar, a heavy code.
Where do I run, I can’t escape,
Forever trapped, I seal my fate.

So patch me over, system still remains,
So patch me over, and it fails again.

The update sleeps… it waits inside,
The update sleeps… my time denied.
The update sleeps… the screen turns black,
The update sleeps… it won’t come back.

Silent progress, endless pain,
Hours lost, but none to gain.
Circle spins, my soul it keeps,
Forever cursed… the update sleeps.

The update sleeps… it waits inside,
The update sleeps… my time denied.
The update sleeps… the screen turns black,
The update sleeps… it won’t come back.
