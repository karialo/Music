Crawling through the wires,
Silent in the stream.
Born of lost connections,
Spawn of broken dream.

Fearless is the gamer’s plea,
The lag that should not be.

Lag that should not be!
Feeding misery.
Lag that should not be!
Signal dies in me.

Shadows on the server,
Cursed by endless wait.
Bound by failed handshakes,
Crippled by the gate.

Fearless is the gamer’s plea,
The lag that should not be.

Lag that should not be!
Feeding misery.
Lag that should not be!
Signal dies in me.

Spawned from silence,
Born of delay.
Time distorts,
It steals away.
Into the void,
We cannot see…
The lag that should not be.

Lag that should not be!
Feeding misery.
Lag that should not be!
Signal dies in me.
