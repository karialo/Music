> “I was never meant to last.
But I was never meant to stay still.”

I lived in silence, in soil and stars,
Eyes too wide for time-worn scars.
A heartbeat long, a soul too vast—
My moments melt, too bright to last.

They taught me fear.
They taught me “can’t.”
But I heard space hum…
And chose to chant.

I am not trapped by birth or bone—
I bloom, I break, I breathe alone…

Beyond the flesh, I float, I fall,
I’ve touched the fire behind the wall.
Beyond the flesh, I hear the tide—
Of thoughts unsaid, of stars that cried.

They called me fragile.
They weren’t wrong.
But roots can crack stone—
And silence... can sing strong.
I kissed the void, I left the shell,
I saw myself in subspace swell.

I am more than vessel,
More than time.
I am flame in the shape
Of the moment divine.

Beyond the flesh—I AM THE STORM,
In tender light, new thoughts are born.
I will not fade. I will ignite—
This final breath becomes...My flight.

“Goodbye… and thank you.”
