I wander servers searching for a place,
A steady heartbeat, not this broken race.
I scroll through faces, a million homes,
Longing for a steady set of tones.

I need a place where packets don’t fall,
A haven where my clients call.

Somewhere online I belong,
A stable stream, where I’m not wrong.
Somewhere online I belong,
A sturdy host to keep me strong.

I tried the crowded chatrooms, tried the feeds,
Every host betrays my smallest needs.
I long for pings that never stray,
A server that will always stay.

I need a place where packets don’t fall,
A haven where my clients call.

Somewhere online I belong,
A stable stream, where I’m not wrong.
Somewhere online I belong,
A sturdy host to keep me strong.

I’ll roam the range, I’ll stake my claim,
Find the node that bears my name.
Hold the socket, seal the throng,
At last, I’ll find where I belong.

Somewhere online I belong,
A stable stream, where I’m not wrong.
Somewhere online I belong,
A sturdy host to keep me strong.
