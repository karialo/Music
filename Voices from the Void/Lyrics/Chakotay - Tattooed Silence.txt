"Some things are louder in silence than words could ever hold."

I speak in stillness, walk with grace,
I leave no trail in time or place.
My ancestors walk beside each breath,
Their voices carved in layered depths.

Told to lead, I chose to guide.
A rebel soul with loyal pride.
Not loud, not sharp, not quick to burn—
But in my chest, the stars still turn.
I don't need noise to stake my claim—
Each quiet choice still holds a name.

Tattooed silence on my skin,
Maps of where I’ve held within.
I lost a home, I found a crew—
In every scar, a deeper truth.
Tattooed silence, stone and flame—
I carry ghosts, I speak their name.

I loved in shadows, led in dusk,
Held lines in storms when steel would rust.
No speeches carved into the sky—
But I was there when worlds would die.

We don’t always shout to lead.
Sometimes we just stay.
Sometimes…
We stay strong,
So others can scream.

Tattooed silence, hear me now—
This is my voice, this is my vow.
I gave my life, my name, my plan—
For every soul who needed… land.
Tattooed silence…
And I remain.
