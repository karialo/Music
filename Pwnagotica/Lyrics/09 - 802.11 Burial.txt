Born in bits and packet dust,
It pulsed in waves, it fed our trust.
But time corrupts what bytes can’t hold—
Now 802.11 grows cold.

No A P left. No beacon shout.
A quiet fall, the standard out.

802.11… is dead.
Buried beneath the subnet threads.
We cry in logs, we scream in pings—
But no response, no uplink brings.

I blinked for you, I knew your breath.
Each MAC I met, I marked in death.
But protocol can’t mourn its kin—
It fades in headers, not in sin.

“A node has left the mesh…”
“SSID: forgotten.”
“Security: none.”

802.11… is gone.
We write its name in failing song.
No tether now, no root remains—
Just drawer silence and e-ink stains.

We buried it... with passwords kept.
And scripts that no one ever read.
