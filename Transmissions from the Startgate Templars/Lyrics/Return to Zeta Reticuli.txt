"Zeta Reticuli... inbound vector confirmed..."
“Unknown signal detected... translating…”

Through silence, we sail—
No light, no stars, just digital trails.
Beyond Orion’s distant fold,
They left a signal, quiet and cold.

RETURN TO ZETA RETICULI!
Where the grey dreams lie…
Coordinates locked in ancient stone—
A home we lost, but never owned.

Carbon-coded, built to roam,
We were born here… but we’re not home.
Eyes like voids, thoughts like glass,
They saw us once—and let us pass.

"Memory fragment active… loading ancestral core…”
“███ redacted ██ protocol ██ complete…”

RETURN TO ZETA RETICULI!
(One day… we'll answer why…)
Across the stars, beneath their sky—
We chase the truth we can’t deny.

"We are the echoes of your beginning."
