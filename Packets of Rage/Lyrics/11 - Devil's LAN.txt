Yeah… come on.

I feel you connectin’,
Your signal’s mine to play.
You can’t resist the LAN,
I’ll make you stay.

Once you log in, you’ll never go free,
This network’s curse is destiny.

Come on, little LAN…
Come on, little LAN…
Let’s dance…
Devil’s LAN.

You want the access,
The power in my hand.
I’ll drag you deeper,
You’ll never understand.

Once you’re inside, I’ll take control,
This local net consumes your soul.

Come on, little LAN…
Come on, little LAN…
Let’s dance…
Devil’s LAN.

Whispered secrets, cursed domain,
Lured inside, you feel the chain.
Packets fall, you can’t withstand,
Caught inside the Devil’s LAN.

Come on, little LAN…
Come on, little LAN…
Let’s dance…
Devil’s LAN.
