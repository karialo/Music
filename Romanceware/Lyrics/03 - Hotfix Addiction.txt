Another patch, another thrill,
update me until I spill,
lines of code across my veins,
injecting fixes, chase the pain.

Quick commit, don’t test, just run,
bugs dissolve beneath the sun,
every fix a new affliction,
welcome to my hotfix addiction.

Hotfix addiction—
can’t resist the code injection,
every patch a sweet seduction,
break me with your reconstruction.

Hotfix addiction—
debug dreams in repetition,
love me like a new rendition,
crash again, my true condition.

Patching holes I’ll never close,
error garden, watch it grow,
rollback’s not an option here,
I’m addicted to repair.

Recompile my broken song,
watch me run but not for long,
every cure becomes the sickness,
every kiss another quick fix.

Hotfix addiction—
in the kernel of my soul,
hotfix addiction—
lose control, just lose control.

hotfix addiction—
you’re the bug I can’t outlive,
break me, fix me, break me—
I’ve got nothing left to give.
