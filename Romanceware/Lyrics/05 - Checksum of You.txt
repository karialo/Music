Every packet I replay,
every line you wrote in gray,
I run the test but it won’t pass,
our connection couldn’t last.

Integrity has slipped away,
bits corrupted, night to day,
and though I search for something true,
I can’t rebuild the checksum of you.

Checksum of you,
every byte I lose reminds me too,
broken streams and fragments fall,
you’re the code I can’t recall.

Checksum of you,
hashing love that won’t renew,
lost inside this endless queue,
I can’t restore the checksum of you.

Lost in echoes, silent pings,
failing handshakes, severed strings,
you were flawless in my eyes,
til the error made me blind.

Resend, retry, but still denied,
the data fades, the truth won’t hide,
if love’s a test, then I’ve come through,
but I can’t pass the checksum of you.

Checksum of you,
every byte I lose reminds me too,
ghosts of signals fade from view,
I’ll never find the checksum of you.
