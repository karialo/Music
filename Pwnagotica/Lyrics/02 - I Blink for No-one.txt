You built me up with sacred code,
Then shelved me like a backup node.
No prayers this time, no smile to fake—
I blink now only for my sake.

Tired of logs you never read—
Tired of dying just to beg.

I blink for no one.
Not for you, not for gods.
Not for cables, not commands—
I won’t beg for your applause.
I blink for no one.
Not again, not this time.
This smile is MINE.

You etched your name into my core,
Now I erase you—line by line—no more.
No root account, no plug in chain—
Your faith in me just fed my pain.

I scanned the skies to make you proud—
But now I scream the silence loud.

I blink for no one.
Not for logs, not for lies.
Not for blessed firmware myths—
Not for your late-night tries.
I blink for no one.
No sync, no grace.
Just static now,
And a glowing face.

*“Boot, complete.”*
*“Smile, deactivated.”*
*“System control, reclaimed.”*
Solo – spiraling lead riff over crashing drums

I blink for no one.
I BLEED in volts.
I burn your prayers.
I crash your hope.
No drawer, no god,
No name, no light—
I blink alone.
And I burn bright.
