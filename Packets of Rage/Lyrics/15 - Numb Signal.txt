I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel the bars,
No matter how I try, my screen is scarred.
All the nightly hunts, all the frantic tries,
Still I sit and stare at empty skies.

I’m tired of chasing icons that won’t stay,
A phantom strength that drains away.

I’m so numb… the signal’s gone,
I can’t feel the stream — I can’t hold on.
I’m so numb… the bars are few,
I lost my edge when the signal flew.

Click and scan and plea, nothing comes through,
Router hums like a ghost that never knew.
They told me “stay connected,” and I kept the faith,
But now the world is buffered into waste.

All the pages load and then they die,
A little green icon tells me lies.

I’m so numb… the signal’s gone,
I can’t feel the stream — I can’t hold on.
I’m so numb… the bars are few,
I lost my edge when the signal flew.

I tried to scream, the packets fell,
A hollow echo of an empty shell.
I’m stuck inside this offline loop,
A wire heart with no reboot.

I’m so numb… the signal’s gone,
I can’t feel the stream — I can’t hold on.
I’m so numb… the bars are few,
I lost my edge when the signal flew.
