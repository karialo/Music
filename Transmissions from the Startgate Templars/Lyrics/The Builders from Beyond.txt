Down in the desert where the secrets sleep,
Under stone so heavy, so ancient, so deep,
The stars whispered numbers to the sand-worn hands,
And the hammers rang out across uncharted lands.

COULD IT BE... E.T. with a masonry degree?!
Laser-cut limestone in perfect symmetry!
Did they carve the cosmos into every geometry?
Or were we just the blueprint in a prophecy?!

Puma Punku gates with precision divine,
Nazca lines etched for a ship to align,
Fire in the sky, gods from the machine,
Every myth a memory in our coded gene.

They came from the void… with compasses of light…
Built cities of thought… beneath eternal night…
O builder, O watcher, O celestial bee…
Who gave us fire? Who taught us to be?

COULD IT BE... E.T. with a masonry degree?!
Stackin’ blocks like Tetris in 2500 B.C.!
Hoverin’ cranes and anti-grav mystery—
WHO DARE SAY IT WAS JUST HUMAN HISTORY!?

So when you gaze upon the stars and feel the call...
Remember: maybe we didn’t build it all.
Maybe the truth’s not in books or TV...
But in the hands... of an E.T. with a masonry degree...
