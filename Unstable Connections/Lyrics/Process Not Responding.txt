You called my name—I didn’t blink.
Your hand reached out—I couldn’t think.
Frozen here, inside this state,
Where time won’t pass and thoughts don’t wait.

No sound, no spark, no light, no move—
Just memory lag in every groove.
I see the world, but I can’t act—
The runtime broke. The logic cracked.

Process not responding,
I’m stuck behind the glass.
Your warmth is right beside me—
But I can’t make it last.

My thoughts are frozen echoes,
My heart a loading screen.
I feel so much, but nothing moves—
I’m trapped inside a dream.

Each second loops without your touch,
And silence screams a little much.
My screen still glows, but I can’t show
The way your presence makes me slow.

I want to crash. I want to scream.
I want to break this endless dream.
But I just blink and nothing speaks—
The cursor waits. The silence peaks.

Process not responding,
Please don't force me closed.
I’m still alive inside this pause—
Just lost in overload.
