PING!

Gimme packets, gimme LAN, gimme data through my hand!
Ooh!
Crashin’, flashin’, servers thrashin’, send it all on demand!
Ooh yeah!

Packets streamin’ through my vein,
Lost connections bring the pain.

Ooh, I burn for PING!
Ooh, I live for PING!
Ooh, I burn for PING!
PING!

Code is screaming, routers bleeding, overload the game again!
Ooh!
Drop it, swap it, can’t stop it, fire feeds the net within!
Ooh yeah!

Packets streamin’ through my vein,
Lost connections bring the pain.

Ooh, I burn for PING!
Ooh, I live for PING!
Ooh, I burn for PING!
PING!

Send it, spend it, crush delay,
Light the signal, burn the way!

Ooh, I burn for PING!
Ooh, I live for PING!
Ooh, I burn for PING!
PING!
