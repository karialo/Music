I wake before the warp core hums,
I taste-test stew with quantum thumbs.
I smile, I greet, I overtry—
I’m the guy who brings your lunch... and lie.

They call me cheerful, call me weird,
A walking apron with a beard.
But I’ve stared into a thousand stares,
That said: “We’re fine. We don’t need... cares.”

I laugh too loud. I hug too tight.
I’ve never once... been told I’m right.

But I try—by the stars, I try!
To patch the hope in your supply.
I tell a joke, I burn the roast,
Just to feel like I belong the most.
Morale’s not just a duty shift,
It’s how I fake my soul’s own rift.
I feed you joy and scrape the pan—
Because I still don’t know... who I am.*

I lost my world, my name, my kin.
I painted smiles on broken skin.
Sometimes I wonder if I stayed...
Because without you, I’d fade.

I held Kes’s hand...
And still let go.
I cheered for Tuvok...
He said “no.”

But I try—oh spirits, I try!
To make this ship a lullaby.
Through burnt soufflés and one-man shows,
I give you warmth... no matter who knows.
You are my family, this ship my light,
So I will smile… with all my might.

"Good night, Voyager... I’ll see you in the mess hall."
