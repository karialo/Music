I’m your only band, I’m your only speed,
I’m your weaker hand, I’m your daily need.
I’m your only lane, choked and over-fought,
I’m the signal pain, the one you never sought.

Sad but 2.4…
Sad but 2.4…

I’m your weakest link, slow and never true,
I’m the one you hate, still you’re stuck with too.
I’m the lagging game, I’m the buffer wheel,
I’m the cursed chain, crawling at your heel.

Sad but 2.4…
Sad but 2.4…

You… you suffer, crawl through the noise,
You… no other, left with no choice.

I’m your bottleneck, I’m your endless stall,
I’m the one that fails, dropping out your call.
I’m the cursed wave, ghost across your floor,
I’m your only band… sad but 2.4.

Sad but 2.4…
Sad but 2.4…
