Fortune, Wi-Fi fades away,
Lost in static, night and day.
Caught between the bars so thin,
Hollow echoes deep within.

Packets lost, I still complain,
Endless wait, but all in vain.

The signal remains…
The signal remains…

Hopeless, cursed to roam,
Disconnected, far from home.
Every promise fades to lies,
Empty screens before my eyes.

Packets lost, I still complain,
Endless wait, but all in vain.

The signal remains…
The signal remains…

Drift away, fade away,
No escape, no delay.
Through the noise, through the chains,
The signal remains…

The signal remains…
The signal remains…
