Load the system, watch me go,
lights are flashing, overflow,
post my log, then hit the groove,
watch this machine start to move!

BIOS sings a little tune,
bootloader hums along in June,
drivers line up, shake their feet,
kernel’s got that steady beat.

Do the boot scoot, kick the RAM,
stomp your feet, I know I can!
Power up, let’s shake the floor,
I’m alive and wanting more!

Do the boot scoot, don’t be shy,
raise your circuits to the sky!
From the startup to the root,
everybody do the boot scoot!

Background tasks can join the line,
daemons dance in perfect time,
update servers clap their hands,
while processes all form a band.

Break it down—reset, retry,
watch the packets multiply,
every crash just finds the beat,
every error moves my feet!

Do the boot scoot, kick the RAM,
stomp your feet, I know I can!
Spin the drives and shake your head,
dance until the logs turn red!

Do the boot scoot, loud and bright,
party till we lose the night!
From the startup to the root,
everybody do the boot scoot!
