Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but Wi-Fi won’t align.
Where do I stream it all again?
To live it may never end.

So tear me open, buffer still remains,
So tear me open, and it stalls again.

Until it streams, it holds me tight,
Until it streams, I lose the fight.
Until it streams, the screen is black,
Until it streams… it won’t come back.

Where do I search to make it flow?
The bar is stuck, it will not go.
Where do I find the speed I crave?
Connection lost, I am enslaved.

So tear me open, buffer still remains,
So tear me open, and it stalls again.

Until it streams, it holds me tight,
Until it streams, I lose the fight.
Until it streams, the screen is black,
Until it streams… it won’t come back.

I take this pain, I hold it near,
No signal now, no stream to hear.
Forever cursed, I sit and wait,
Until it streams… it’s far too late.

Until it streams, it holds me tight,
Until it streams, I lose the fight.
Until it streams, the screen is black,
Until it streams… it won’t come back.
