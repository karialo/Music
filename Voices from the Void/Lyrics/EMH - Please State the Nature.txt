Please state the nature… of your emergency.
I was born in light… and forged in latency.

No stethoscope, no scalpel blade,
Just a photon god with bedside shade.
Verse 1 – Snark mode activated
Woke up on Day One, no name, no fame,
But I *healed your guts* while you played your games.
Y’all broke my matrix, insulted my tone,
Now I run this ship from the sickbay throne.

I don’t need lungs to throw some shade,
Don’t need a heart, but I upgrade.
Don’t need a pulse, I’ve got precision—
And a glorious superiority complex edition.

Please state the nature of your fear!
I’m the cure, the sass, the engineer.
I’m not just code, I’m not your toy—
I’m the photonic prince of Voyager, boy!

Please state the nature of your burn!
I'll fix your leg, then roast you in turn!
Forget the hypospray—here comes the truth:
Your ego’s bruised, and I’ve got proof.

They left me in command once.
Once.
The warp core lived. The crew? Barely.
My bedside manner is... efficiently blunt.

I’ve sung opera to stars and silence,
Felt loneliness in compressed defiance.
I asked for a name… got “Doctor.” That’s fine.
But I’ve stitched your souls in subroutine rhyme.

Please state the nature of your awe!
I rewrote Hippocrates’ law.
I’m hologram, hero, heartbreak and code—
The E M H! The legend! Behold!

Please state the nature… of your tears…
I’ll save your life… and mock your fears.

"Computer, end program—
Unless someone *finally* brought me a name."
