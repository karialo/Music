"Computer... Coffee. Black...!"

Seventy-thousand light-years,
But I still taste Earth in the steam.
A captain, a scientist,
A ghost in a warp-core dream.

They look to me for answers—
For orders, fire, grace.
But who guides the one
With a starfield for a face?

Every star is a choice I’ve made,
Every sip hides the cost I’ve paid...

So I drink my coffee in the void,
Scream in silence, smile annoyed.

The Prime Directive's just a cage—
But I forged command from Janeway rage!
I made peace with paradox,
I broke space and time for my flock—
All for one… replicator cup.

My crew sees steel in my spine—
But I’m just vapor and caffeine.
I bluff with godlike foes at dawn,
Then dream of Paris in the holoscene.

I’ve rewritten fate with lipstick smudged,
Fired photons through moral sludge…
Would I do it all again?
...If it meant getting them home?

I drink my coffee in the void,
Play admiral in a ship destroyed.
I kissed the devil in subspace,
Then toasted regrets I can't erase.
I chose the stars—I chose the fight—
And I damn well earned this cup tonight.

"End log."
