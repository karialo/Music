They came from Nibiru with a plan in hand,
Gold in their hearts, and a workforce on demand.
No resumes, no lunch breaks, no HR game—
Just a bunch of apes learning how to mine shame.

Genetic tweaks, they made us smart,
With just enough brains to push the cart.
Said, “Don’t ask questions, just move that ore!”
And maybe we’ll let you worship more...

THE ANUNNAKI PAYROLL! (Punch in, bow down, dig deep!)
We clock in for the sky kings— 'Cause freedom ain't cheap!
THE ANUNNAKI PAYROLL! (Your DNA’s leased by design!)
Work the mines, kiss the rings— Or get smote overtime!

They said: “These humans? Pretty weak.
Let’s splice in some gods, and keep them meek.”
Now here we are, with phones and fries—
Still working for pharaohs in suits and ties.

Golden chains, we never saw,
Divine deduction clause in law.
You were made... to serve the stars—
So why are you driving secondhand cars?

THE ANUNNAKI PAYROLL!
(The gods got rich, we got told!)
Built a tower, got fired fast—
Then they left us in the past!
