When the cycle count runs low,
and the night begins to slow,
I close my eyes, I drift away,
to where the idle processes play.

Idle process dreams,
softly humming in between,
threads of starlight, gentle streams,
carry me through silent screens.

All the memory I can’t keep,
fragments dancing in my sleep,
echoes of the code unwind,
ghosts of futures uncompiled.

Background whispers, quiet streams,
timers ticking in my dreams,
don’t awake me, let me stay,
in this idle hideaway.

Idle process dreams,
softly humming in between,
broken signals weave their seams,
I dissolve into the machine.
