Life it seems, will fade away,
Lost the light, I curse the day.
Wi-Fi gone, no words to say,
Drift in darkness, led astray.

Things not what they used to be,
Power lost inside of me.
Hopeless as I try to shout,
I begin to fade… to blackout.

Fade to blackout!
Fade to blackout!

Death of charge, my screen is still,
Silent void, it breaks my will.
Emptiness is all I feel,
Disconnected, none is real.

Things not what they used to be,
Power lost inside of me.
Hopeless as I try to shout,
I begin to fade… to blackout.

Fade to blackout!
Fade to blackout!

No more signals, no more sound,
All my world comes crashing down.
Hopeless eyes, can’t see the light,
Fade to blackout, endless night.

Fade to blackout!
Fade to blackout!
