> “We looked for them in tombs… in myths…
But they were never under the dirt.
They were above it. Watching.”

We built our myths from stone and fire,
Named our gods, then raised them higher.
But the sky remembers what we forgot—
The builders, the watchers, the war they fought.

THE TRUTH WAS NEVER BURIED!
(It’s etched into the light!)
They didn’t leave—they uploaded.
And now we dream in bytes!

THE TRUTH WAS NEVER BURIED!
(The relics were the key!)
Open the vault of ancient stars—
And set your memory free!

From Nazca lines to Babylon’s tears,
They gave us maps... then disappeared.
But in our blood, the signal hums—
The truth returns when Disclosure comes.

> “We were made in their image...
But edited for control.”
“Ascension was never prophecy… it was protocol.”

THE TRUTH WAS NEVER BURIED!
(It floated in the sky!)
You called them myths and stories—
But they’ve been waving all this time.

> “We were never alone… We just forgot to look up.”
