Fingers on the wire, signals running blind,
searching for a partner on the other side.
Packets fall like whispers, fragile in the stream,
handshakes in the dark, I wonder if you dream.

No encryption strong enough to hide,
the pulse of trust that beats inside.

Handshakes in the dark—
I reach for you through broken sparks.
Even when the network falls apart,
I’ll find you, through unstable hearts.

Handshakes in the dark—
your signal’s faint but leaves a mark.
Even if we never see the light,
I’ll hold your ghost tonight.

Timeouts echo silence, still I press “retry,”
faith is just a protocol that never says goodbye.
Every dropped connection is another prayer,
to find you in the static, to know you’re still there.

In the shadows, code will bind,
two lost signals, one design.
No collapse can tear apart,
these handshakes in the dark.

Handshakes in the dark—
I reach for you through broken sparks.
Even when the network falls apart,
I’ll find you, through unstable hearts.

Handshakes in the dark—
your signal’s faint but leaves a mark.
If this is all we get tonight…
I’ll keep the ghost alive.

Handshake complete… connection never ends.
