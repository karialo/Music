> In the beginning… there were only stars... and whispers.
Whispers from beyond.
Before Google. Before Gutenberg. Before the wheel…
There was the craft.

Carved into stone, in silence they screamed,
Truths in the granite we still haven’t dreamed.
Eyes to the skies, minds in a trance,
Dancing with shadows in cosmic romance.

They came before the Wi-Fi,
Before the fire, the forge, the fear.
Encoded in temples and tales,
Their voices still echo here.

Obelisks rise where logic falls,
Golden gods walked through wormhole halls.
They lit the night with impossible beams,
And vanished like echoes from forgotten dreams.

> Time… is a circle.
History... a hologram.
And we... are the footnotes...
Of their galactic memoirs.

They came before the Wi-Fi!
Built cities with no known tools!
They coded the stars, they mapped our DNA,
And now we’re just fools... with shiny glass rules.

> “Find the gate. Follow the light. They’re still watching.”
