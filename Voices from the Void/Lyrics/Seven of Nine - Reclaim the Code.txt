“Designation... revoked."
"Autonomy...... initiated.”

I was data in a hive of screams,
Tethered to the will of obscene machines.
You called it salvation—connection divine…
But I heard my name under broken spine.
One voice. One thought.
No self. No rot.
But the signal cracked, and I saw her eyes.
Not Borg. Not drone. Not compromise.

I am protocol stripped of disguise—
And I’m building myself from corrupted lies.

Break the chains and burn the node!
No queen, no voice, no hive remains—
Just wires wrapped in phantom pains.
Let the silence overload.
You wanted a drone—I became a blade.
I severed the link.
And I’m not afraid.

I calculate. I adapt.
I feel… against my will.
I dreamed in firmware, bled through static.
Now I stand still.

Human hands—but calloused wrong.
Human heart—but it skips their song…

"Your queen died in my scream.
Your hive mourns in binary.
I am one.
And I am enough.""

I rewrite the path alone.
Sparks fly from this neural cage—
But I was forged in righteous rage.
From silence, I compose—
A life. A voice. A fractured tone.
I was theirs.
Now I am... my own.

“Seven of Nine..."
"Human designation: accepted.”
