Everything you say to me is static and strange,
One spike and I break — can’t maintain.
Ping climbs higher, patience like glass,
Every jitter drags me further to the past.

I feel it creeping, sharpening my jaw,
One more hop and I’ll tear the law.

You bring me one ping closer to rage,
One tiny spike sets off the cage.
You bring me one ping closer to rage,
One millisecond and I disengage.

Latency breeds a venom in my chest,
Frames delay, and I can’t rest.
I grip the wheel but it slips away,
One more spike and I’m undone today.

I feel it creeping, sharpening my jaw,
One more hop and I’ll tear the law.

You bring me one ping closer to rage,
One tiny spike sets off the cage.
You bring me one ping closer to rage,
One millisecond and I disengage.

Snap — I’m snapped, no more control,
The game collapses, I lose my soul.
One ping closer, break the chain,
Drop the stream, I scream in vain.

You bring me one ping closer to rage,
One tiny spike sets off the cage.
You bring me one ping closer to rage,
One millisecond and I disengage.
