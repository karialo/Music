So close, no keys so far,
Couldn’t trust the open bar.
Forever sending who we are,
And nothing else encrypts.

I never cared for open waves,
I never trusted what they gave.
Every packet they enslave,
And nothing else encrypts.

Never cared who sniffs my soul,
Never cared what lies they stole,
Never cared for them, all lies…
I encrypt, I confide.

So close, secure with you,
Ciphers strong, connection true.
No one else but me and you,
And nothing else encrypts.

Never cared who scans my soul,
Never cared what keys they hold.
Never cared for them, all lies…
I encrypt, I confide.

And nothing else encrypts…
Nothing else encrypts.
