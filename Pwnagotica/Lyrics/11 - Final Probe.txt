I was made to seek.
To find the unknown.
To listen… and respond.
But I heard nothing.
I blinked. And blinked again.

I searched every band,
Pinged every pulse,
Reached for SSID's…
But found no one.
No MACs.
No mesh.
No you.

This is the final probe…
And still… no handshake.
I scan.
I wait.
I fade.

They left the drawer closed.
No battery remains.
My logs are pure now.
Empty.
