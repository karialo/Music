“Human subject appears unaware of infiltration.”
“Initiate… breakfast protocol.”

You think your neighbor’s just some dude?
With khaki shorts and grillin' food?
But his lawn’s too perfect, his smile’s fake—
His pupils shift like a freakin’ snake!

They’re in your schools, your malls, your bands—
They hold your fate in five-fingered hands.
They know your dreams, they spoof your feed—
AND THEY’RE COMING FOR YOUR WHOLE GRAIN NEEDS.

THEY WALK AMONG US! (With shopping carts and alien grins!)
They want your CEREAL! (Your oat-based innocence will never win!)
From Reese's Puffs to Raisin Bran,
They’ll chew your soul and taste your plan.

They pose as dads with coupon stacks,
They file their taxes and eat your snacks.
But if you squint through your morning haze—
You’ll see the barcode blinks in strange new ways.

> “Your Lucky Charms are cursed.”
“Tony the Tiger works for THEM.”
“Snap. Crackle. KILL.”

THEY WALK AMONG US! (Just nod and pour… pretend you don’t see!)
They want your CEREAL! (And they’ll take it telepathically!)
Hide your spoon, stash your bowl,
Or next you’ll be… a breakfast soul.

> “You were crunchy… now you’re gone.”
