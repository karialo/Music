Wish you had the key,
To lock it down for free.
Searching for the trust you lost,
No security.

Beg, and you will fail,
Cry, and still derail.

Where’s your cipher now?
Where’s your cipher now?
Where’s your cipher now…
Key Nothing!

Wish you kept it safe,
Now the breach will take.
Every secret left behind,
Every code they break.

Beg, and you will fail,
Cry, and still derail.

Where’s your cipher now?
Where’s your cipher now?
Where’s your cipher now…
Key Nothing!

Down in the dirt,
Your password’s gone.
Nothing is left,
The trust undone.

Where’s your cipher now?
Where’s your cipher now?
Where’s your cipher now…
Key Nothing!
