It’s been seven years. Still no pips.
I man the night shift. I check the core.
I’ve patched the breaches, held the door.
I’ve died in loops, I’ve saved the crew—
They said “well done,” then looked right through.

I’ve faced the void, I’ve played the part—
Still they don’t see the captain’s heart…

But I’m still Ensign—name tag neat,
My dreams on pause beneath my seat.
Still Ensign—no medals glow,
But I’ve kept this ship from breaking slow.
Still Ensign—no command code key,
But I lead in silence... they don’t see me.

I watched them rise. I stood behind.
I smiled and stayed. I didn’t mind.
But late at night, when stars don’t speak,
I dream I’m more than mild and meek.

Promotion’s not a rank you’re given—
It’s a weight that you have already driven.
I bled for stars. I broke the mold.
I’m not made of brass… but I am bold.

Still Ensign—but don’t mistake
This heart of fire for their mistake.
Still Ensign—but I command the night,
With unpipped pride and quiet might.
Still Ensign—but I know I’ve grown...
And when we get there— I’m going home.

“Computer… end log.
Maybe tomorrow.”
