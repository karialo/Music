Crawling in my LAN, these packets will not land,
Every node I touch slips through my hand.
Wires twist and bind, the ping is hard to find,
Lost in local maze, no peace of mind.

And I can’t escape this looping blame,
All these ports are clogged, I’m hearing shame.

Craaaaaaawling in my LAN…
These packets they will never stand.
Craaaaaaawling in my LAN…
I reach for cables, grips of sand.

Hosts that never wake, sockets torn and frayed,
The lights blink false and promises degrade.
I patch a busted route, but it dissolves again,
Every handshake breaks, I’m sinking in.

And I can’t outrun the endless strain,
Lost frames echo, driving me insane.

Craaaaaaawling in my LAN…
These packets they will never stand.
Craaaaaaawling in my LAN…
I reach for cables, grips of sand.

I’m calling names that never reply,
Nodes are ghosts behind my cry.
Crawl, crawl — can’t make it right,
Crawl forever through the night.

Craaaaaaawling in my LAN…
These packets they will never stand.
Craaaaaaawling in my LAN…
I reach for cables, grips of sand.
