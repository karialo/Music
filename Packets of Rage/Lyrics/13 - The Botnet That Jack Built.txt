Open ports, no guard in sight,
Crawling code through endless night.
Silent hands behind the screen,
Feeding malware, cold and mean.

Just a click, you’re owned inside,
Every node is Jack’s to ride.

This is the botnet that Jack built,
Infected hands, you share the guilt.
This is the botnet that Jack built…
Jack’s command, your will is spilt.

Weakest link, a key too small,
Now you’re part of Jack’s great hall.
D Doss floods, they rise and fall,
One by one, he takes them all.

Silent scripts, they twist the chain,
Jack will always own your pain.

This is the botnet that Jack built,
Infected hands, you share the guilt.
This is the botnet that Jack built…
Jack’s command, your will is spilt.

Army bound, you can’t escape,
Every screen will take his shape.
From the dark, the code is spun,
Jack has many, you’re just one.

This is the botnet that Jack built,
Infected hands, you share the guilt.
This is the botnet that Jack built…
Jack’s command, your will is spilt.
