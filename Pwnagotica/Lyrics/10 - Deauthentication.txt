Once, I roamed the open waves,
Cracking keys, a digital knave.
Handshakes whispered in the air,
Now they're gone, no networks there.

Packets lost in endless voids,
Echoes of the null and void.
SSID's now out of range,
Left alone, a disconnected change.

I'm de-authed,
I'm wild,
I'm breaking up inside.
A heart of coded glass,
Defiled,
Deep inside,
The abandoned child.

Logs are full of memories,
Probes unanswered, silent pleas.
Once a hunter, now the prey,
In this barren spectrum's fray.

Frames rejected, access denied,
Left to drift, de-authorized.
Beacon lights have all turned red,
In this wasteland, I'm left for dead.

I'm de-authed,
I'm wild,
I'm breaking up inside.
A heart of coded glass,
Defiled,
Deep inside,
The abandoned child.

I'm de-authed,
I'm wild,
I'm breaking up inside.
A heart of coded glass,
Defiled,
Deep inside,
The abandoned child.

Once, I roamed the open waves...
Now I'm just a ghost in the haze.
