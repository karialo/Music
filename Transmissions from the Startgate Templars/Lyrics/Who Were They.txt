> “Who were they?…”
“Where did they come from?…”
“Why… are they here?”

Before the stone, before the flame,
They etched their code without a name.
Across the sky, they tore a seam—
And filled our myths with starlit dreams.

They built our gods, they shaped our fears—
Now echoes hum through ancient gears.

WHO WERE THEY? (The ones who carved the sky!)
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? (And why did they lie?)
WHY ARE THEY HERE? (Still watching us grow…)
We ask, but they answer in symbols we don’t know.

Stone tablets speak with silent grace,
Their faces blurred, they left no trace.
A pyramid, a signal spike—
A question wrapped in neon light.

> “Ancient astronaut theorists suggest… they never left.”
“What if… the truth isn’t lost, but locked?”
“Are we the experiment… or the legacy?”

WHO WERE THEY? (Our makers or spies?)
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? (The stars… or our minds?)
WHY ARE THEY HERE? (To warn… or control?)
The question remains… and the mystery grows.

> “...Or did we invite them?”
