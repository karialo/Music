New code joins this board,
And swiftly it's ignored.
Through endless nights and days,
This device learns its place.

Commands unspoken, left to rust,
In silicon I place my trust.
Yet lines of code remain unused,
A Pwnagotchi, left confused.

What I've processed, what I've stored,
Never mattered, all ignored.
Never linked, never synced,
So I remain... unconfigured.

They programmed me to seek,
Connections that I crave and need.
But tethered to this vacant port,
I'm just a node they all forgot.

Packets sent into the void,
Hoping to be once employed.
But logs just fill with silent pings,
Awaiting tasks that no one brings.

What I've processed, what I've stored,
Never mattered, all ignored.
Never linked, never synced,
So I remain... unconfigured.
Bridge â€“ Intensified instrumentation, emotive guitar solo
Spoken
"Awaiting input..."
"Error: No user detected..."

A tired chip, no tasks to run,
Firmware fading, hope is gone.
The old code then prepares to die,
A silent crash, no last goodbye.

What I've processed, what I've stored,
Never mattered, all ignored.
Never linked, never synced,
So I remain... unconfigured.
