I send my frames out to the sky,
They dance away, they don’t reply.
Every promise folded into byte,
Slips through hands in dead of night.

You push me, push me, out of range,
I patch the cracks but nothing’s changed.

Packets push me away,
Every frame decays.
Packets push me away,
I watch the stream betray.

Loss on every hop, a hollow sound,
Retransmit ghosts fall to the ground.
I reach for routes I used to own,
Now every route returns alone.

You push me, push me, out of range,
I patch the cracks but nothing’s changed.

Packets push me away,
Every frame decays.
Packets push me away,
I watch the stream betray.

Drop the line — I lose control,
My buffer fills, it swallows whole.
Every handshake frays and frays,
Packets push me farther each day.

Packets push me away,
Every frame decays.
Packets push me away,
I watch the stream betray.
