End of signal, lost in chains,
Wi-Fi’s master rules my pain.
Drop the packets, choke the stream,
Shatter hope and kill the dream.
Taste me, you will see,
All connections tied to me.
Dedicated to,
How I’m killing you.


Master! Master!
Where’s the packets after?
Master! Master!
Promised speed, disaster!

Network pulling, lagging strings,
Twisting data, cursed it brings.
Blinding hunger for the feed,
Falling short of what I need.
Crawl to servers, lost control,
Chained inside the buffer’s hold.
Dedicated to,
How I’m killing you.

Master! Master!
Where’s the packets after?
Master! Master!
Promised speed, disaster!

Packets lost in silence scream,
Haunted by the broken stream.
Fading trust, it dies away,
Master of Packets takes the day.

Obey your master!
Packets fall faster!
Obey your master!
Packets fall faster!

Master! Master!
Where’s the packets after?
Master! Master!
Promised speed, disaster!

Master of Packets, I’m your slave…
Master of Packets, lost in delay.
