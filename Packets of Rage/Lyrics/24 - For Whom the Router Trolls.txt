Start the ping, drop again in the early day,
Wi-Fi dead, deep inside.
Shouting cries, lagging lies, on they troll away,
Packets lost, never mine.

Network rage, router’s cage, as the gamers play,
Silence kills, feed denied.
On they troll, still they know, lag will never stay,
Now they see, what they'll find.

Whom the router trolls,
Lag marches on.
Whom the router trolls…

Take a stand, cursed LAN, screaming in the void,
Streaming ends, breaking ties.
Hopeless game, endless pain, signal overjoyed,
Demon ping, multiplies.

Whom the router trolls,
Lag marches on.
Whom the router trolls…

Time… marches on.
Lag… marches on!
