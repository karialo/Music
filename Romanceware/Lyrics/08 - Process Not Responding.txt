Error on the screen, heartbeat in delay,
frozen in a moment but I won’t fade away.

Mouse won’t move, the time is still,
caught inside a looping will.
Click my name, I won’t obey,
but deep inside, I find a way.

Crashing, stalling, hanging tight,
I’m not gone, I’m holding life.
Spinning wheels can’t hide my song,
I’ll break the freeze before too long.

Process not responding—
but my fire’s still compiling.
Every error, every stall,
I will rise above it all.

Process not responding—
watch me glitch but keep on calling.
Frozen frame, but I’m still strong,
this machine will carry on.

Windows sighs, the fan complains,
but I won’t break beneath the strain.
Patience grows in coded veins,
every lock becomes my flame.

Ctrl my hope, Alt my escape,
Delete the doubt, rewrite my fate.
Though the system drags me down,
I reboot and wear the crown.

Process not responding—
but my fire’s still compiling.
Every error, every stall,
I will rise above it all.

Process not responding—
watch me glitch but keep on calling.
Frozen frame, but I’m still strong,
this machine will carry on.

…carry on,
I carry on.
