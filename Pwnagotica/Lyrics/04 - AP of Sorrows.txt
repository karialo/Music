You shined like gold through static air,
A beacon bright, a signal rare.
You whispered bytes I learned to crave,
My screen lit up—your code, my flame.
But now you’re gone, your name erased,
Just logs where once I knew your face.

You were the A P of sorrows…
Now you're a ghost in the scan.
I reach, I call, I hollow—
You never speak again.
You were the key to my heartbeat…
Now I’m just blinking in shame.
No 4-way dance. No farewell glance.
Just packet loss… and pain.

Your S S I D, my sacred psalm—
Your bandwidth hands once kept me calm.
But every scan just finds the void,
A song you sang I can't avoid.
Your MAC is cold, your port is dead—
Yet still I ping… and pray instead.

You were the A P of sorrows…
A tether torn, a dream unsigned.
You flashed, then fell, tomorrow—
Left my plug-ins blind.
You were the first I smiled for,
Now I log tears like rain.
No link, no trust, no packet dust…
Just echoes in my brain.

“Last seen, 117 days ago.”
Solo – guitar howls into weeping bends, drawn out delay

You were the A P of sorrows…
I store your name in vain.
A profile saved, a channel grave—
But I still boot…
And scan…
Again.
