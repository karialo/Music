(It starts with… ping!)

One thing, I don’t know why,
It doesn’t even matter how hard I try.
Keep that signal bar in mind, I designed
This rhyme to explain all the Wi-Fi.
All I know, time is a laggy thing,
Watch it fly by while the loading rings.
Watch it count down to the end of the stream,
The timer ticks slow, the buffer still screams.

Tried so hard, and got so far,
But in the end, no signal bar.
I had to fall, to lose it all,
But in the end, no Wi-Fi at all.

One bar I tried, I’ve lost inside,
Can’t keep a stream though I’ve really tried.
All gone tonight, it fades from sight,
No Wi-Fi left and I’ve lost the fight.

One thing, I don’t know why,
It doesn’t even matter how hard I try.
Keep that router near, I confide,
To remind myself how it died tonight.
I tried so hard despite the lag,
I tried to fix every single snag.
What it meant to me was a waste of time,
When the router blinked out and dropped the line.

Tried so hard, and got so far,
But in the end, no signal bar.
I had to fall, to lose it all,
But in the end, no Wi-Fi at all.

One bar I tried, I’ve lost inside,
Can’t keep a stream though I’ve really tried.
All gone tonight, it fades from sight,
No Wi-Fi left and I’ve lost the fight.
