He came from the stars... or maybe just Greece,
With theories so spicy they never release.
Suits of confusion, eyes full of fire,
And a hairdo that climbs like a radio spire!

Defying physics, denying calm,
That follicle crown's a psychic bomb.
Not just a man, he's a meme divine—
Spittin’ truth from the fringe with a mutant hairline.

HAIR OF THE TSOUKALOS!
(Gravity cries at the height of his ‘fro!)
Slicked by the gods, blown by the void—
Styled by secrets they tried to avoid!

HAIR OF THE TSOUKALOS!
(Curls like a vortex of ancient woes!)
He doesn’t need proof—just volume and shine,
And a theory that warps space-time!

Aliens? He’s not saying for sure...
But he’s definitely not saying no, monsieur.
He walks through ruins, poses in light—
And shouts “TECHNOLOGY!” with holy fright.

> “Let’s just... assume... for the sake of argument...
that every structure ever built was touched...
by beings from Sirius B.
Now ask yourself… who styled my hair?”

HAIR OF THE TSOUKALOS!
(Spiraling truths in a follicle flux!)
Defender of madness, prince of the fringe—
He combs through the cosmos and never cringes!

> “I’m not saying it was aliens…
But it was definitely conditioner.”
