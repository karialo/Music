> “Millions of blocks... each weighing tons...
Cut. Moved. Placed.
Without concrete. Without lasers.
Or... did they have lasers?”

Polished stone, aligned with stars,
Encoded angles from Venus to Mars.
Dust of kings, math divine—
Blueprints buried in every line.

Who lit the spark in the desert sun?
Who knew the weight of Pi, undone?
Too sharp to fade, too clean to crack—
No way some dudes just built it with yak.

PYRAMIDS IN 4K! (Rendered in STONE, but who pressed PLAY?)
Stacked like code from a cosmic array— Ancient .EXE on display!
PYRAMIDS IN 4K! (No scaffolds, no cranes—just WHY and HEY?!)
Who gave them math? Who taught that way? WHO TAUGHT THE ROCKS TO OBEY?!

Coordinates match the speed of light,
In Orion’s belt they sleep at night.
Mirror to heaven, tomb or node?
Or simply... a Stargate in download mode?

> “As above... so... below...
As within... we upload...”

PYRAMIDS IN 4K!
(Were they encoded like DNA?!)
Stone turned pixel, mystery display—
Are we the sequel, or are we the prey?

> “The gods left... but their buildings stayed.”
