> *“My mother wanted a warrior.
My father just wanted to leave.”*

Bloodline split like a cracked EPS line—
One side roars, the other rewinds.
They called me half, they called me wrong,
Said “choose a side”—I chose a bomb.

I don’t fit. I don’t fade.
I rewire what the cowards made.
Fists like fire. Brain like war.
I duct-tape peace to a broken core.

Every choice a circuit sparked—
Every scar, a blueprint marked…

Halfbreed voltage—wired in pain!
Built my strength from acid rain!
Spit in the face of shame and name—
I’m not split, I’m not tame.

Halfbreed voltage—burn and bend!
Blood and fire, I won’t pretend!
I’m the fuse and the flame—
Don’t you EVER ask me to blend.

My fists remember every sneer—
Every corridor of fear.
But I earned these tools, this rank, this fire—
Not despite the rage... Because of it.

I built this ship from fury.
I welded my name into every bulkhead.
Half-blood. Full power.

HALFBREED VOLTAGE—NO MORE CHAINS!
Rewrote my soul in plasma veins!
I was torn—but now I tear back!
Your categories? They crack.

HALFBREED VOLTAGE—FEED THE STORM!
I’m not broken, I’m REBORN.
